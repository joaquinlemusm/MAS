# Determining the spring constant through Simple Harmonic Motion using Arduino
This project implements an experiment to determine the spring constant of a spring using the concept of Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) and the Arduino platform. SHM is an oscillatory motion that follows a sinusoidal path and is characterized by a restoring force proportional to displacement. The spring constant is directly related to this restoring force.

## Description
Simple Harmonic Motion is a physical phenomenon that can be studied by measuring the frequency and mass in a mass-spring system. This project utilizes a position sensor connected to an Arduino to record the position of an object attached to a spring as it oscillates.

## Components
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Position sensor (e.g., potentiometer or ultrasonic sensor)
- Spring
- Object of known mass
- Breadboard and connecting wires

## Operation
The position sensor records the position of the object attached to the spring as it oscillates. With this information, the frequency and period of the harmonic motion can be determined. The spring constant is calculated from the mass of the object and the parameters of the harmonic motion.

## Repository Contents
Arduino_Code: Contains the source code necessary for reading the position sensor and calculating the spring constant.
